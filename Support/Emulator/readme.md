# Cycle-exact Minimal 64x4 Emulator (written in C++, Win64 .exe)

IMPORTANT: The image file 'flash.bin' (see section 'Revision .../FLASH Images') needs to reside in the same directory as the emulator .exe.

On some graphic cards, 60Hz VSYNC is not detected correctly. In that case, set the frame rate manually to 60Hz from within your graphic card's control center.

Please note that the C++/OpenGL source code of this emulator (~6000 lines of code) is intentionally not available for download.
