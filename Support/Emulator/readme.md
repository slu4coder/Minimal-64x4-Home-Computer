# Cycle-exact Minimal 64x4 Emulator (written in C++, Win64 .exe)

PLEASE NOTE: A FLASH image file 'flash.bin' (see section 'Revision .../FLASH Images') needs to reside in the same directory as the emulator .exe
(for German keyboard layout, rename the provided 'flash_de.bin' to 'flash.bin').

On some graphic cards, 60Hz VSYNC is not detected correctly. In that case, set the frame rate manually to 60Hz from within your graphic card's control center.

Please note that the C++/OpenGL source code of this emulator (~6000 lines of code) is intentionally not available for download.
